SUSE Prototype website assignment

Descritpion:
Adding a different flavour to website for user visiting. Idea is to have minimal click for user trying to search for information from the website.

Steps to Run the application:
1) Clone the repo 
2) use any IDE of your preference.(I used VS editor). 
3) If using VS editor or any other IDE install "Live server" or can use an exisiting server available by the IDE to open the webpage.
4) once the plugin is installed, right click index.html and choose "Open with live server"
